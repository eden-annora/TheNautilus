# TheNautilus
a small html canvas gamedev experiment, uses javascript and html to build a small game.

The goal is to find out what happened to the colossal space freighter that goes by the tail number NAU-0605, callsign The Nautilus.
you are tasked with piloting a small cubesat into the massive vessel, what happens next is up to you, 
whether you rip through its guts and vanquish all that lies within or gently explore the ecosystem that's developed in its vast halls.

Either way you'll quickly find that not everything is as it seems!

this code is ideally not used outside of this project, please dont just yoink the whole thing, that would be appreciated, however...
Feel free to use my (terrible) homegrown vector2D library, or steal snippets of math, i doubt any of it will actually be useful.
the vector 2D has distance to line built right in, which took me forever to get working... so i imagine having the bundled thing would be semi useful.

libraries used:

howler : an amazing js library for seamless audio intergration!

  WEBSITE: https://howlerjs.com/
  GITHUB: https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/

any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated, from cleaning up syntax to suggestions on how to un-scuff my codebase a little. 

Thanks for stopping by!
