# TheNautilus
a small html canvas gamedev experiment, uses javascript and html to build a small game.

the goal is to find out what happened to the collossal space freighter that goes by the tailnumber NAU-0605, callsign The Nautilus.
you are tasked with piloting a small cube sat into the massive vessel, what happens next is up to you, 
whether you rip through its guts and vanquish all that lies within or gently explore the ecosystem thats developed in its vast halls.

either way youll quickly find that not everything is as it seems!

this code is ideally not used outside of this project, please dont just yoink the whole thing, that would be apprecieated, however...
feel free to use my (terrible) homegrown vector2D library, or steal snippets of math, i doubt any of it will actually be useful.
the vector 2D has distance to line built right in, which took me forever to get working... so i imagine having the bundleded thing would be semiuseful.

any ideas or suggestions would be much apprecieated, from cleaning up syntax to suggestions on how to unscuff my codebase a little. 

thanks for stopping by!
