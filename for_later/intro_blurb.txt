NAU-0506 is a derelict freighter that's drifted into a signal dead zone. We have no signal repeaters out there and any repeaters we try to push close immediately go offline once they get within radar range.

you will be remotely piloting a specialized experimental vessel, nicknamed Cubert^3.

MISSION OBJECTIVES:
#0: AVOID TRIGGERING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AT ALL COSTS.

#1: ACQUIRE A NEURAL MYCELIUM SAMPLE.

#2: SCAN OBJECTS OF INTEREST WITH THE WIDEBAND MATERIAL ANALYZER.

#3: GAIN ACCESS TO THE SHIPS BLACKBOX LOGS.

#4: PLACE SIGNAL REPEATERS WITHIN THE VESSEL.

NOTES:
# LOSS OF THE CONNECTION TO THE CUBESAT WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF YOUR EMPLOYEE STATUS. 

External scans show that what appears to be an organic material has permeated the entire ship's superstructure. 
NAU-0506â€™s radar beacon has been outputting an extremely faint and garbled signal for a while now.
